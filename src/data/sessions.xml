<session title="A/B Testing with Squabble" stream="ColdFusion">
<![CDATA[
<p>You have two designs, one with a blue button, and one with a red button, and you think that both designs could work on your a feature of your application. The problem is, how do you know which one is actually better? Which design is going to convert more users into giving you their hard earned dollars through your application?</p>
 <p>The fact of the matter is, you don't actually know. You can only make a guestimate based on your experience as a web application developer, and hope for the best. &nbsp;Unfortunately, real users can be a fickle bunch that do unpredictable things, and it can be very hard to track what the overall effect of all these changes to a site can make.</p>
 <p>Squabble is a server side A/B testing framework for ColdFusion that allows you to test multiple variations of site design and/or functionality against your real users, in real time, and quantify the results into statistics that can actually prove which combination of variations results in your application getting more of the conversions that you require. This gives you amazing freedom in being able to try out new things on established sites, as you are able to track what changes actually effect the behaviour of your real users, and then continually improve upon them.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p class="p1">Historically nearly all of Adobe's server products are built on top of Java and a JVM so that regular cross-overs into the Java world when it comes to deploying or extending Adobe solutions are unavoidable.&nbsp;The Java Virtual Machine is the foundation of any Java-based application or architecture and still most of us treat it as a black box and have to apply some dark arts when it comes to monitoring, adjusting and tweaking JVM settings. </p>
 <p class="p1">This talk will be an introduction into memory management and garbage collection tuning with the JVM. We will start with some discussion about memory sizing, the different memory generations and the object lifecycle across those. From there on we'll look at memory management in large 64-bit heaps and accompanying issues with cleaning up the mess (e.g. the available JVM Garbage Collection strategies and when to use which). Along the way I'll show a few useful tools to monitor JVMs, to inspect heap memory and to look into resp. visualise the Garbage Collection behaviour of our apps.</p>

<p>In many ways, I am probably one of the most myopic presenters having spent so long talking about the JVM but the reality is this. The default install of ColdFusion is eons away from providing anything like a scalable core for CF applications and it gets worse with 64-bit installs.<br /><br />Most
]]>
<![CDATA[
of the time that ColdFusion has depended on a JVM we have been in a 32-bit world, this meant we had a 2GB ceiling for the JVM heap and when we take intoconsideration the permanent generation which exists in addition to the JVM heap this meant 1.4GB maximum for the heap, which comprises of the young/new and old/tenured generations combined.<br /><br />Along came 64-bit which blasts us past the old 2GB limitation on 32-bit, caused by contiguous memory architecture. However, we are now seeing elongated pauses forJVM memory collection, also known as &ldquo;garbage collection&rdquo;. The larger the heaps, the longer seem the pauses, here is a quote from a recent technical blog on the issue &ldquo;a 20GB data set will take tens of seconds of stop-the-world time to compact&rdquo;. Obviously, a pause in excess of ten seconds is not acceptable in a web application.<br /><br />In the presentation, which will be largely practical, we will show some mitigation strategies for a 64-bit JVM which hopefully will include &ldquo;BigMemory&rdquo; from EHCACHE-Terracotta; more on that soon.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>
 Why bother with Object-Oriented Programming
 Unlike many of our peers working with other languages, ColdFusion programmers can feasibly choose to simply ignore OOP. If you've made that choice, do you feel guilty about it, or at least somewhat defensive? Do you feel that you're being asked to
]]>
<![CDATA[
take on faith that OOP will somehow be "better"? Does OOP in ColdFusion actually seem harder than procedural coding? 
 </p>
 <p>
 This talk is not an introduction to ColdFusion's OO language constructs - there are many excellent tutorials already out there. Instead, I start from the premise that coding at all levels is a design activity, and therefore OOP can most usefully be described in terms of the design problems it helps to address. Once you know the Why, the How gets a lot easier - and in fact we may cover a bit of the How by way of example.
 </p>
 <p>
 I'll go on to argue that there are some features of the ColdFusion ecosystem (and in that I include its human inhabitants) that make learning and transitioning to OOP uniquely challenging. Pretty much from day one we're confronted with those "am I stupid, or is this hard?" moments. I'll try to point out the hard bits, so you can focus on minimizing the stupid :)

<session title="Writing Domain Specific Languages using Custom Tags" stream="Other">
<![CDATA[
<p>ColdFusion's raison d'&ecirc;tre has always been to provide abstractions for common jobs from the domain of Internet application development - prefix a popular protocol, web form control or task with an angle bracket and a cf and more often than not there's a tag for the task.
 <br />
 <br />
 In the same way that CFML makes Internet application development far easier than doing the same in general-purpose languages like C and Java, we can create even more specialised "domain-specific" languages (DSLs) to elegantly and repeatably solve problems in fields like model-driven-development, product pricing/configuration, accounting and content management. DSLs can be created using lexer/parser generation tools like ANTLR or Lex/Yacc/Bison, but for ColdFusion developers there is an easier way.<br />
 <br />
 Custom tags are often thought of as an archaic HTML-ish alternative to user-defined functions, but there's a lot more to them than that. In this presentation Robin will quickly review the full set of custom tag features in CFML, and show how easy it is to create your own custom language out of collaborating sets of custom tags, with walk-thoughs and examples from real enterprise applications responsible for tens of millions of dollars in client revenue each week.</p>
